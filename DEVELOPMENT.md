Development environment is managed with `pip-tools`. Sync current env with runtime, dev and interactive work requirements by calling `pip-refresh.sh`. This should be done after adding a new dependency. It won't update any package versions unless necessary. `pip-refresh force` will remove current reqs and create them from scratch, most likely installing most recent deps.

Local development of rotsim2d, rotsim2d_apps and molspecutils is supported `local_update.sh` script located at each project's root. It will build the package, upload it to local pypi server and install it in the projects that depend on it.
