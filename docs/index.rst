rotsim2d: rotationally-resolved 2D infrared spectra
===================================================

**rotsim2d** is a library to model two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) rovibrational
spectra. It uses Mukamelian density-matrix perturbation theory treatment of
third-order interaction. It assumes explicit time-ordering of interactions,
i.e. it is suitable for time-domain spectroscopy with time-separated optical
pulses.
